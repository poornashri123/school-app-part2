<h2>  Our Principal's Message </h2>

<p> “Every child has a light within them, Every ray of light that is radiated by them makes them shine in the wide world”

    The spokes that help our school to turn its wheel smoothly are the parents. Being the first teachers of the students they play a proactive role. We are grateful to our parents for their sincere involvement in the School. Without their  co-operation  the school cannot offer the holistic education .Let us join hands and work together to provide our children strong foundation to help them build successful and happier lives towards fulfilling our vision of “Developing Shining , Responsible Global Citizens”!
